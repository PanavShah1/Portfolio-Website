                <p>
                    I really love playing sports! Whether it's table tennis, 
                    tennis, or chess, each game is exciting in its own way. 
                    I enjoy the fast back-and-forth in table tennis, the energy 
                    of tennis matches, and the thinking challenges of chess. 
                    Playing sports is not just fun; it also keeps me active and 
                    helps me think better.

                <p>
                    I started playing tennis when I was just 6 years old. After taking 
                    a long break from this sport for a long time, I joined my
                    school team and since then it's been a remarkable journey. I continue to play
                    tennis in the institute.

                <h2>Table Tennis</h2>
                <p>
                    Table tennis like many others started as a casual pastime.
                    Just a few of my friends and I playing every evening.
                    Then i got into my school team and it has remained as a hobby till now.

                <p>
                    The chess boom was the reason I got into this "sport".
                    This became the sole reason for me wasting countless hours during my JEE prep. 
                    Playing online became a daily routine, especially during the COVID pandemic.
