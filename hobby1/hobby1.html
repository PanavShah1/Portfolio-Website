                <p>If you catch me caught up in the intricate dance
                    of cubes, you've stumbled upon one of my greatest fascinations

                <h2>Me in cubing</h2>
                <p>I was introduced to the fascinating realm of cubing by my dad. He taught
                    me how to solve one side of the 3x3 when I was not even 7.
                    And now I can solve all sorts of cubes. You won't find me go by a day
                    without touching my cubes.
